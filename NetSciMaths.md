## Graph Theory
Graph Theory has a birthday.  It started out back in 1736 with [Leonhard Euler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler) (1707-1783).
This took place at a time when he lived in [Konigsberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Königsberg)

With the problem known as: [Seven Bridges of Konigsberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Bridges_of_Königsberg)

Eularian Trails

"graph" was coined by James Joseph Sylvester (American Journal of Mathematics)

Notation of a graph: G(V,E)

Hassabis says that many challenges remain in DeepMind’s goal of developing a generalized AI system. In particular, its programs cannot yet usefully transfer their learning about one system — such as Go — to new tasks; a feat that humans perform seamlessly. “We’ve no idea how to do that. Not yet,” Hassabis says.

In Go, all stones are worth the same and their influences can be felt through vast distances across the board.

## Trees

Branching factor:
The number of children at each node (or the out-degree).  When this value is not uniform an average
branching factor can be calculated.
